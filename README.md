This project was created for a competition hosted by FaceDev. The challenge was to design a custom website for WebX, which in my case I chose to create a chatroom.
Unfortunately, WebX is no longer hosted, so the chatroom is no longer functional. However, this repository exists to preserve the project.

I achieved second place in the competition! ðŸŽ‰

Fun fact: The backend uses a spritesheet to store and manage information.
